## React Fundamentals Used

- **Functional Components**: Used for creating reusable and stateful components.
- **State Management with `useState`**: Used for managing local component state.
- **Event Handling**: Used to handle events like clicks, form submissions, and state changes.
- **Props**: Passed data from parent components to child components.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between pages (e.g., home, product detail, cart, etc.).
- **useEffect**: For managing side effects like fetching data or subscribing to services.
- **LocalStorage**: For persisting data (e.g., cart items and wishlist) across page reloads.

## Data Handling and Management

- **LocalStorage**: Used to persist cart and wishlist data between sessions, ensuring that items remain in the cart even after refreshing the page or reopening the browser.
- **Context API**: Used to share state between components without prop drilling, making it easier to manage user data (such as cart and wishlist items) globally.
